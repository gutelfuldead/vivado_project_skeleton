==============================================
Xilinx Vivado Project Version Control Skeleton
==============================================

Reference tree structure for source controlling Xilinx Vivado projects.

Tested in Vivado versions

- 2017.1
- 2018.1

Includes,

- Makefile : to handle checking proper versions and automating build runs
- argument driven tcl scripts to generate bd from a tcl, create bitstream,
  and generate output run logs

TODO For all New Projects
=========================

1. Update ./src/tcl/proj_gen.tcl with correct ``board_part`` or ``part``
        as described in tcl section

2. Update Makefile with correct Vivado Version Number
        as described in Makefile Section

3. Update Makefile with project names
        as described in Makefile Section

Makefile
========

The Makefile needs to be modified for every new project to set a few project specific parameters

Vivado Version
--------------
This value prevents someone from using a different version of Vivado to generate the
project leading to potential errors ::

        VIVADO_REQ_VERSION ?= 2017.1

Valid Targets
-------------

These are the names given to each project in the directory. They must be
explicitly set in the Makefile ::

        VALID_TARGETS = dummy_project_1 \
                        dummy_project_2

These correspond with identical names in the bd and xdc directories

Generate Project
----------------

To generate a project and build the bitstream run ::

        make build TARGET=dummy_project_1

Tree Structure
==============

files and directories ::

        .
        ├── Makefile
        ├── README.rst
        └── src
            ├── bd
            ├── ip_catalog
            ├── outputFiles
            ├── tcl
            │   ├── build_bitstream.tcl
            │   └── proj_gen.tcl
            └── xdc

        6 directories, 4 files


bd
--

This folder should contain the tcl file used to generate the block diagram
For example::

        dummy_project_1.tcl
        dummy_project_2.tcl

After creating the block diagram tcl script from Vivado
it may be necessary to update the origin variable inside ::

         set origin_dir .

ip_catalog
----------

This folder should contain all IP that is used in the design; svn externals
should be placed here.

output_files
------------

This folder is where the bitstream, hdf, and various reports are placed after
the design is finished running.

tcl
---

This folder contains two tcl scripts to generate the projects

``build_bitstream.tcl`` used to go through synthesis, implementation, place and
route, and finally generate the bitstream. This will populate the output_files
folder when complete.

``proj_gen.tcl`` used to generate the Vivado project. The ``board_part`` property
MUST match the intended hardware ... OR be replaced by a ``part`` specifically

Example using a ZedBoard (default) ::

        set_property -name "board_part" -value "digilentinc.com:zedboard:part0:1.0" -objects $obj

Example using a zynq 7035 part with no specific board ::

        set_property -name "part" -value "xc7z035fbg676-2" -objects $obj

xdc
---

This contains the constraints for the project. Currently proj_gen.tcl will only
pull in the constraints that have the same project name prefix.

For example, if the following files are present ::

        dummy_project_1.xdc
        dummy_project_1_timing.xdc
        dummy_project_1_io.xdc
        dummy_project_2.xdc

and ``make build TARGET=dummy_project_1`` is ran then the project will be generated
with ::

        dummy_project_1.xdc
        dummy_project_1_timing.xdc
        dummy_project_1_io.xdc

automatically added to the constr_1 set.
